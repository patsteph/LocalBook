## v1.9.0 — iPhone Scan Capture + Signed/Notarized Releases (in progress)

### Sprint 7 — Continuity Camera sidecar
- **`src-tauri/tools/continuity-camera/`** — New Swift CLI sidecar (`ContinuityCamera.swift`) that captures one image from a paired iPhone and returns the path as JSON. After two dead Apple API paths on macOS 26 Tahoe (`NSPerformService "Capture.ImportImage"` removed; `ICDeviceBrowser` no longer enumerates Continuity iPhones — confirmed via `pbs -dump_services` and Image Capture.app), settled on **AVCaptureDevice `.continuityCamera`** as the only public path that works.
- **Tauri wiring** — `tauri.conf.json` registers the sidecar as `externalBin`; `lib.rs` exposes `trigger_continuity_camera` command that spawns it and parses JSON. `Info.plist` declares `NSCameraUsageDescription`.
- **Entitlements / signing** — `com.apple.security.device.camera` on the sidecar; dual-mode `build.sh` signs with Developer ID when available, adhoc otherwise. Deployment target bumped to macOS 14 (required for `.continuityCamera`).
- **Tahoe Info.plist compliance** — `NSCameraUseContinuityCameraDeviceType` added to the main app's `Info.plist` and embedded into the sidecar binary via `-sectcreate __TEXT __info_plist` (without this key, AVCaptureDevice silently returns zero Continuity iPhones on macOS 14+). New `ContinuityCamera-Info.plist` carries the bundle id, usage description, and the opt-in key for the sidecar.

### Sprint 9.1 — Continuity Camera moved in-process (sidecar deleted)
- **Why the sidecar had to go** — Even with the right `importFromDeviceIdentifier` placeholder and a correctly-installed `NSServicesMenuRequestor`, the Swift sidecar would auto-populate the AppKit menu with iPhone capture items but tapping one did nothing: the captured image data never reached our `readSelection:`. Root cause: macOS's pasteboard-services routing keys off Launch Services-registered `.app` bundles, and a single-file adhoc-signed sidecar binary isn't registered as one. LocalBook.app *is* registered, so the only reliable fix is hosting the responder inside LocalBook itself.
- **`src-tauri/src/continuity.rs`** — New module (~480 lines) implementing the full Insert-from-iPhone flow in Rust via `objc2 0.6` + `objc2-app-kit 0.3`. Defines `LBContinuityResponder` (an `NSResponder` subclass conforming to `NSServicesMenuRequestor`), installs it into the main window's responder chain (between `contentView` and the window), pops an `NSMenu` containing the magic `NSMenuItem` placeholder, and bridges back to tokio via a `oneshot::channel` with a 3-minute capture budget.
- **`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`** — `trigger_continuity_camera` is now a thin wrapper around `continuity::trigger(app)`; the legacy `camera_id` / `include_non_continuity` params are accepted-and-ignored so the frontend doesn't need to change. `tauri_plugin_shell::process::CommandEvent` import dropped.
- **Sidecar fully removed** — Deleted `src-tauri/tools/continuity-camera/` (Swift source, build script, entitlements, Info.plist), both pre-built `src-tauri/binaries/continuity-camera-*-apple-darwin` binaries, the `externalBin` entry in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, the Step-2 sidecar build in `build.sh`, and the matching initial-install + rebuild blocks in `install.sh`. `release.sh` comment updated. Net effect: one fewer signed binary to ship, one fewer entitlements file to maintain, zero IPC.
- **Bonus bug fixes** — The old "10 dismissals to close" bug (recursive auto-repop on menu cancel) is gone; cancel now just resolves the oneshot once and restores the responder chain. Multi-page Scan Documents from the iPhone returns N image paths in a single command response, which `RichNoteEditor.runInlineOcr` already handles via `/scan/ocr-batch`.
- **New deps (macOS-only)** — `objc2 = "0.6"`, `objc2-app-kit = "0.3"`, `objc2-foundation = "0.3"` added to `Cargo.toml` under `[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")'.dependencies]`. All three were already in the transitive graph via `window-vibrancy 0.6` so the lockfile barely changes.

### Sprint 9.3 — Continuity Camera identifier fix (menu was greyed-out)
- **Root cause** — The placeholder menu item's identifier was hardcoded as the literal string `"NSMenuItemImportFromDeviceIdentifier"`, but the actual runtime value of the AppKit extern constant is an opaque string that does NOT equal the symbol name. AppKit never recognised the placeholder → Continuity Camera substitution never engaged → menu showed a greyed-out "Insert from iPhone" label with no device submenu.
- **`src-tauri/src/continuity.rs`** — Now imports the real `NSMenuItemImportFromDeviceIdentifier` constant from `objc2-app-kit`. Also broadened `validRequestor` to return `self` for ANY non-nil returnType when sendType is nil (covers Take Photo images, Scan Documents PDFs, and Add Sketch). Added diagnostic log of the actual identifier value.

### Sprint 9 — iPhone-side capture + inline OCR insertion
- **iPhone owns the capture experience** — `src-tauri/tools/continuity-camera/ContinuityCamera.swift` rewritten on top of Apple's documented `NSMenuItem.importFromDeviceIdentifier` flow. The Mac shows a tiny "Connecting to iPhone…" launcher; AppKit auto-pops a contextual menu populated with iPhone-side capture modes (Take Photo, Scan Documents, Add Sketch); the user picks once and then drives the rest from their iPhone screen — shutter, framing, multi-page batching all happen there. Multi-page Scan Documents returns N images in a single sidecar invocation. Replaces the old AVCaptureDevice live-preview window. Two non-obvious correctness requirements kept biting us before this stuck: (1) the menu must contain an `NSMenuItem` whose `identifier` is `NSMenuItem.importFromDeviceIdentifier` — AppKit *replaces* this placeholder with iPhone items at open time, so an empty menu silently falls back to generic Services items that never reach the iPhone; (2) the receiving `NSResponder` (an `NSView` subclass conforming to `NSServicesMenuRequestor`) must be the key window's `firstResponder`, otherwise AppKit's responder-chain walk never hits our `validRequestor`.
- **Frontend collapsed to one menu entry** — The Mac-side scan menu used to expose two iPhone variants (Scan Documents / Take Photo). Now a single "📱 Insert from iPhone…" entry; the iPhone screen makes the same choice with a much better UI.
- **Inline OCR → open note** — Captures and file-picker scans now OCR through the new `POST /scan/ocr-batch` endpoint (`backend/api/scan.py`) and append the merged markdown into the *currently-open* note at the cursor position via `editor.getTextCursorPosition()`, instead of forking a separate scan note. Backend pipeline refactored: `services/scan_pipeline.py` extracted `_ocr_pages_and_merge()` shared core, added `process_batch_inline()` returning `{merged_text, page_texts, total_pages, chars}`.
- **Frontend consolidation** — `RichNoteEditor.runInlineOcr()` is now the single source of truth used by the file picker, single-shot Continuity capture, and the multi-page session-finish handler. `ScanSessionPanel` gained an optional `processBatch` prop so its progress bar drives the same pipeline. `scanService.ocrBatchWithProgress()` shares the SSE reader with `processBatchWithProgress` via a typed helper.
- **Dead code removed** — `CameraPickerModal.tsx` deleted (AppKit now picks the iPhone). Tauri command `list_continuity_cameras` and the `ContinuityCameraInfo` Rust struct removed from `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`. The legacy `--camera` / `--include-non-continuity` sidecar flags are accepted-and-ignored for backward compat. The old `--list` mode stays — still useful for diagnostics.

### Sprint 8 — Multi-page scan sessions
- **`src/components/ScanSessionPanel.tsx`** — Thumbnail grid with reorder/delete/retry, drives the batch flow from the note editor.
- **`src/services/scanSession.ts`** — Versioned `localStorage` persistence so a session survives reload.
- **`src/services/scanService.ts`** — SSE client mirroring `uploadWithProgress` for per-page progress.
- **Backend `POST /scan/process-batch`** — New SSE endpoint in `backend/api/scan.py` + `process_batch` in `scan_pipeline.py`. Merges pages with `--- PAGE N ---` markers. Fixed duplicate-class bug and a broken `ws_manager` import (→ `broadcast_update`) picked up along the way.

### Signing + notarization pipeline
- **`release.sh`** — Pre-flight checks for `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` / `APPLE_TEAM_ID`; dynamically injects the signing identity into `tauri.conf.json` at build time (never committed); adds notarization (`xcrun notarytool submit --keychain-profile localbook-notary`) + stapling + Gatekeeper verify. Old standalone `scripts/build-signed-release.sh` removed.
- **`backend/build_backend.sh`** — Dual-mode: Developer ID + hardened runtime + entitlements when the env var is set, adhoc fallback otherwise. Signs the PyInstaller bundle and every nested binary.
- **`build.sh` / `install.sh`** — Both now invoke the sidecar build before `npm run tauri build` so end-user installs produce a working (adhoc-signed) sidecar without requiring a Developer Program membership.
- **Build robustness** — `install.sh`'s rebuild path was missing the sidecar build entirely (it was only in the initial-install branch), and Tauri build failures were being coerced to warnings, masking sidecar problems. Both paths now build the sidecar, both unmute its stderr, and both fail loudly with a clear pointer to the manual recovery command. `build.sh` and `install.sh` now also hard-fail with a clear message if `src-tauri/binaries/continuity-camera-*` are missing before invoking `tauri build`. Fixed a pre-existing latent bug where `install.sh`'s rebuild error path called a nonexistent `error` helper (real helper is `fail`).
- **Skip DMG in dev/install builds** — `build.sh` and `install.sh` now pass `--bundles app` to `tauri build`. Tauri's `bundle_dmg.sh` uses AppleScript to set DMG window metadata and fails on machines without Automation permission. End-user installs only need the `.app`; `release.sh` continues to build the full DMG for notarized distribution.
- **`.gitignore`** — Blocks `.signing.env`, certificates, provisioning profiles, notarization zips, and sidecar build outputs from ever reaching the repo.

### Sprint 8 follow-up bug fixes
- **Scan button no longer overlapped by close-X** — `RichNoteEditor` header row now reserves `pr-10` so the parent's absolute-positioned close button (`top-3 right-3`) doesn't sit on top of the Scan button.
- **Scan session no longer leaks across notes** — `ScanSessionState` now carries `noteId`; `loadSession(noteId)` filters by it. Schema bumped to `v2` (legacy `v1` payloads are dropped on first read). Symptom was: any abandoned scan session resurrected itself on every freshly-created `+Note`, even when the user just wanted to type a manual note.
- **Sidecar: strict Continuity-only selection + richer diagnostics** — Removed the silent fallback to `devices.first` that let stranded virtual cameras (mmhmm, OBS, etc.) hijack the session. Discovery now also enumerates `.builtInWideAngleCamera` purely for diagnostics, prints every camera with manufacturer / modelID / uniqueID to stderr, and the failure path returns a multi-line checklist that varies based on whether AVFoundation saw 0 cameras (permission / Info.plist issue) vs. saw cameras but no Continuity device (Continuity itself off, or stale DAL plugin to remove from `/Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/`).

### Curator + sources fixes
- **Weekly-wrap single-flight** — `CuratorAgent.generate_weekly_wrap_up()` (and `generate_morning_brief()`) are now wrapped in async lock + 5-minute / 90-second cache. Symptom was: a long, populated wrap the user was reading would get clobbered by a near-empty second wrap from a concurrent caller (chat intent + UI poll, or scheduler + manual). The save endpoint also gained a guardrail that refuses to overwrite a same-day wrap with non-empty narrative using one whose narrative is empty.
- **Source move-between-notebooks rewrite** — Old endpoint hard-failed with "Source has no content to re-index" for any source whose text lived in LanceDB but not `source.content` (web captures, collector items, sources processed via background path). New endpoint: (1) preserves *every* metadata field (tags, url, author, dates, notes, web/collector provenance, content_date) instead of dropping all but type/format/content; (2) verifies target notebook exists; (3) treats empty-content sources as a metadata-only move with `status=needs_reindex` instead of erroring; (4) if re-ingest fails after the move, returns 200 with a `reindex_error` field so the source ends up in the target notebook with `status=failed` instead of being lost altogether; (5) uses `INSERT OR REPLACE` to flip `notebook_id` atomically — no window where the row exists in both notebooks or neither.
- **Source organization (NotebookLM-style sort)** — New sort dropdown above each notebook's source list, persisted to `localStorage` (`localbook.sourcesList.sort`). Modes: Recently added (default), Oldest first, Title A→Z, Title Z→A, By type (groups note / collected / format), Largest first. Implemented client-side in `SourcesList.tsx` so it's instant; backend already returned `created_at` so no server change was needed beyond surfacing the field on the `Source` TS type.
- **Continuity Camera: per-machine camera picker** — When more than one camera is available (paired iPhone + iPad + built-in FaceTime + leftover virtual cams), the user can now pick which one to scan with. New sidecar `--list` mode enumerates every device AVFoundation sees as JSON; new `--camera <uniqueID>` flag forces a specific device; new `--include-non-continuity` flag lets a built-in / external camera be used as a fallback when no iPhone is around. New Tauri command `list_continuity_cameras` and an updated `trigger_continuity_camera(camera_id, include_non_continuity)`. New React `CameraPickerModal` with iconography per device type, a "Remember this choice" toggle, and persistence to `localStorage` (`localbook.continuityCamera.preferredId`) so subsequent scans skip the picker. Strict iPhone-only behaviour is preserved when no camera is explicitly chosen — virtual / built-in cams are still excluded by default.

## v1.8.0 — Sidecar Lifecycle + One-Click Bonsai Swap (Phase 2)

### Sidecar process management
- **`services/sidecar_manager.py`** — New `SidecarManager` singleton that spawns `llama-server` as a child process, polls `/health` until ready (45 s default timeout), and terminates cleanly on shutdown (SIGTERM → SIGKILL fallback). Layered config: env vars → `user_preferences.json → sidecar` → built-in defaults (binary at `~/src/llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-server` or PATH, model at `~/.localbook/models/bonsai/Bonsai-8B-Q1_0.gguf`, port 8090).
- **Binary + model auto-discovery** — Checks source-built llama.cpp location first (needed for Q1_0 since Homebrew's formula lags), falls back to `/opt/homebrew/bin/llama-server`, then `PATH`.
- **Foreign-process detection** — If the configured port already answers `/health`, the manager adopts the existing sidecar rather than refusing to start. Status API reports `owned: false` so the UI can disable the Stop button for sidecars launched outside the backend.
- **FastAPI lifespan integration** — Auto-starts the sidecar in a background task when the active `main_model` or `fast_model` is a `llama_server`-provider model (or `sidecar.auto_start=true` in prefs); stops it during graceful shutdown. Never blocks backend boot — spawn failures are logged, not fatal.

### One-click swap from Locker / LLMSelector
- **`LLMLocker.analyze_swap()`** — Dropped the Phase 1 `LOCALBOOK_ALLOW_SIDECAR_SWAP` env gate. Sidecar models are now first-class swap targets. Retained a fast `/health` pre-check so a ghost request can't silently swap to a dead backend.
- **`POST /evaluator/swap`** — When the target is a sidecar model, auto-invokes `sidecar_manager.ensure_started()` with a 45 s timeout, invalidates the provider health cache, and only then executes the swap. User flow becomes: click **Use** → sidecar warms up → model becomes active → evaluator picks it up from `config.settings`.
- **`LLMSelector`** (frontend) — Removed the Phase 1 "Labs"/disabled state. Sidecar models are selectable; ⚗ Sidecar badge remains so users know what they're picking. Button tooltip explains the 10–20 s warmup on first use.

### Lifecycle control surface
- **`GET /evaluator/sidecar/status`** — Reports `running`, `owned`, `healthy`, `pid`, `uptime_seconds`, `binary_path`, `model_path`, `model_exists`, `port`, `last_error`.
- **`POST /evaluator/sidecar/start`** — Ensures the sidecar is up (blocks up to 45 s). Returns 503 with structured error detail if Metal init / model load fails.
- **`POST /evaluator/sidecar/stop`** — Graceful SIGTERM, 5 s grace, then SIGKILL. Idempotent. Skipped if the process is foreign (not owned by us).

### Health Portal Locker UI
- **Sidecar status card** — New compact card above the Locker grid. Status dot (green / yellow / grey), model filename, uptime, `owned` vs `external process` label. Start/Stop buttons wired to the lifecycle endpoints. Refreshes the locker model list after any state change so Bonsai becomes selectable / de-selectable in sync.
- **Stop button gating** — Disabled with tooltip for foreign sidecars (launched via `scripts/start_bonsai_sidecar.sh` instead of the backend) so the UI never claims power it doesn't have.

### Tests
- `python3 -m services.llm_provider` now also validates `SidecarManager.resolve_config()` and `.status()` without spawning a subprocess, keeping the smoke suite hermetic.

### What Phase 2 delivers end-to-end
The user story `Bonsai benchmark in five clicks` now works:

1. Open Health Portal → **Locker** tab → Bonsai appears in **Main Reasoning Models** (if sidecar healthy) or greyed (if stopped).
2. Click **Start** on the Sidecar status card → llama-server spins up in ~10–20 s.
3. Click **Set as Main** on Bonsai → backend confirms sidecar health, swaps `settings.ollama_model`.
4. Switch to **Evaluator** tab → click **Run** → benchmark runs against Bonsai via the translator built in Phase 1.
5. (Optional) **Save Current as Default** → next boot auto-spawns the sidecar before the first request.

### Deliberately **not** in Phase 2
- Memory/perf metrics in the sidecar status card (planned for Phase 3 dedicated tab).
- Model picker in the sidecar card (Phase 1 registers exactly one sidecar model — Bonsai; picker only matters once there are multiple).
- Evaluator per-run model override (today you must swap first; a future "run with" dropdown would let you benchmark without touching the active config).

## v1.7.0 — Multi-Provider LLM Infrastructure (Phase 1)

### Foundation for non-Ollama backends
- **`services/llm_provider.py`** — New routing layer with a `Provider` enum (`ollama`, `llama_server`), a `ProviderRoute` dataclass, async/sync health checks with a 10-second TTL cache, and an Ollama↔OpenAI payload translator covering generate + chat, streaming + non-streaming, token usage, and stop sequences. Unknown models fall back to the Ollama route byte-for-byte, so existing behavior is preserved.
- **`ModelInfo.provider`** — New registry field on entries in `known_models.json` (default `"ollama"`). Entries can now be tagged `"provider": "llama_server"` to route them through a locally running sidecar that speaks the OpenAI chat API.
- **`model_registry.refresh_installed_status()`** — Ollama models still checked via `/api/tags`; sidecar models are now marked installed iff the llama-server `/health` endpoint returns 200.

### Call sites threaded through the resolver
- **`services/ollama_service.py`** — `generate`, `chat`, and `stream_generate` now resolve the provider first; Ollama-backed models keep the existing `/api/generate` / `/api/chat` paths, sidecar-backed models translate to `/v1/chat/completions` with streaming SSE parsed back into Ollama-shape dicts so existing callers read `response["message"]["content"]` / `response["response"]` unchanged.
- **`services/rag_llm.stream_ollama()`** — Same routing; token-economy metrics and stop sequences work on either path.
- **`services/model_warmup.py`** — Skips Ollama keep-alive pings for models served by a sidecar (llama-server is always resident).

### Bonsai-8B registry entry
- Added `bonsai-8b` to `known_models.json` (8B params, 1-bit Q1_0 GGUF, 1.16 GB disk, 4 GB RAM min, Apache-2.0, US-origin, `"provider": "llama_server"`). Tagged `experimental` and `sidecar` so it's clearly distinguishable in the UI.

### Evaluator + settings APIs
- **`GET /evaluator/providers`** — New endpoint reporting per-provider health (`ollama`, `llama_server`) with base URL and live status.
- **`GET /settings/ollama/models`** — Now appends registered sidecar models to the returned list when the sidecar `/health` probe succeeds; each row carries a `provider` field for the UI. Uncached response shape is backward-compatible.

### Safety — Phase 1 keeps sidecar models inert in the user UI
- **`LLMLocker.analyze_swap()`** — Rejects any swap to a `llama_server`-provider model unless `LOCALBOOK_ALLOW_SIDECAR_SWAP=1` is set in the environment. When allowed, a live sidecar `/health` check is required before the swap proceeds. Phase 2 (Labs toggle) will flip this gate under UI control.
- **`LLMSelector`** (frontend) — Sidecar models now render with a ⚗ **Sidecar** badge; the Use button shows as disabled "Labs" with a Phase 2 tooltip. Ollama models are unchanged.

### Developer tooling
- **`backend/scripts/start_bonsai_sidecar.sh`** — Convenience launcher. Prefers a source-built `llama-server` at `~/src/llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-server` (needed for Q1_0 since Homebrew's formula lags), falls back to PATH. Supports `--bg` for background mode with logs under `/tmp/bonsai-server.{log,err}`. Reads `BONSAI_MODEL_PATH`, `BONSAI_PORT`, `BONSAI_CTX_SIZE`, `BONSAI_NGL` for overrides.
- **Smoke tests** — `python3 -m services.llm_provider` runs in-memory assertions for the resolver fallback, provider enum parsing, and all four translator functions (generate/chat × stream/non-stream). No pytest dependency introduced.

### Architectural intent
Phase 1 delivers infrastructure only. No user-visible behavior changes on the default Ollama path. Bonsai-8B is wired end-to-end so the Evaluator can benchmark it, but the Locker UI keeps it gated pending Phase 2's Labs toggle + automated sidecar lifecycle.

## v1.6.2

### Upload Experience
- **Granular Ingestion Progress** — The file upload progress bar now streams stage-by-stage updates instead of jumping from 0% to 100%; users see the full RAG journey as it happens (receive → detect format → extract text → analyze → chunk → summarize → HyDE questions → embed → index → tag)
- **"Show journey" Expander** — Optional checklist view reveals every stage with a plain-English description of what's happening and why (e.g. "HyDE questions — generating synthetic questions each chunk answers to boost recall at query time")
- **Per-File Progress** — Each file in a multi-file upload gets its own progress bar, stage label, and completion state; overall bar averages across all files
- **New SSE Endpoint** `POST /sources/upload/stream` — Backward-compatible addition; the existing `POST /sources/upload` is unchanged so agent tools, browser extension captures, and direct API callers are unaffected
- **Reusable ProgressReporter** — New `backend/services/progress_reporter.py` threads optional progress events through `document_processor.process()` and `rag_engine.ingest_document()` with a zero-cost no-op fallback for existing callers

- **Smarter Compound Routing** — Messages like "scrape this video, add the channel, collect daily" now correctly subscribe to the channel, schedule daily collection, and ingest the video in one turn
- **Schedule Keyword Fallback** — "daily", "hourly", and "weekly" in a message are honored even when the LLM classifier doesn't extract them into params

### Sources
- **Consistent YouTube / arXiv Labels** — YouTube videos and arXiv papers now display as `▶️ YOUTUBE` / `ARXIV` regardless of how they were added (chat, browser extension capture, feed-page article, or agent tool); previously some paths mislabeled them as generic `WEB`
- **Full Ingest Pipeline for Chat Adds** — Sources added via `@collector` now run the same pipeline as direct captures, including auto-tagging, content-date extraction, and `document_captured` event logging

## Upgrade Notes

### From v0.6.x
Automatic upgrade. Just replace the app and restart.

### From v0.5.x or earlier
Documents will be re-indexed with new embeddings on first launch. This is automatic but may take a few minutes depending on notebook size.

### From v0.1.x
Data was stored inside the app bundle. Run the migration script BEFORE replacing the app:
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patsteph/LocalBook/master/migrate_data.sh | bash
```
